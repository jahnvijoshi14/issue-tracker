This is a project in which we can create a project and later we can create issues in it, it is a sort of project management software where we can create projects , add issues to it also we can filter and search issues.

to start project use: npm start command.


note :- do install node_modules by npm install.

it will work on :- http://localhost:8000/

we have use express js and mongo db to create this app.


During filter if we add only labels it will filter according to labels , if we add only author it will filter only author but we add both then it will use both to filter that means both condition should be satisfied.

Please note that i have not put any checks since it was not mentioned so , kindly fill all the fields during creating issues and project else it will crash.
